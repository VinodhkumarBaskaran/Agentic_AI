conda create -p venv python==3.12

In conda, the -p (or --prefix) flag is used to specify the full path where a conda environment should be created or activated.

When to use -p instead of -n?
Use -n (or --name) if you want to store the environment in the default location (~/miniconda3/envs/).

Use -p if you want the environment to be created outside the default location, which can be useful for:

Project-specific virtual environments.

Shared environments in a common directory.



conda activate venv/
